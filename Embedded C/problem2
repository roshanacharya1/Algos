2) The factorial of a number N is defined as the product of all integers from 1 up to N. Factorial of 0 is defined to be 1. The number N is a nonnegative integer that will be passed to the program as the first command line parameter. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer N using recursive function.


#include<stdio.h>
int fact(int);
//Recursive function to print factorial of a number.
//factorial is i if input 'n' is either 0 or 1.
int fact(int n)
{
if(n==1 || n==0)
{ return 1; }
else
{ return(n*(fact(n-1))); }
}


int main()
{ int n;
//Initializing 1 value based on user input.
printf("Enter the number:\n");
fflush(stdout);
scanf("%d",&n);
//calling fact function and printing the factorial value.
int d= fact(n);
printf("The factorial of %d is %d\n",n,d);
}
